This site runs on [Workers Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites) and has a small personal bio in addition to a lottery number generator. I might add some more stuff over time but I don't code that much outside of work.

## ClarkTime

[Clark Addis](clarkaddis.com) is a good friend of mine and a while back he made [ClarkTime](clarkaddis.com/get_hour) as an art project. I wanted to learn a bit about `cwebp` and `parallel`, and he took ~43,200 pictures for this project so I decided to port it to Workers Sites just for funsies. This lives at [averyharnish.com/clarktime](https://averyharnish.com/clarktime).
