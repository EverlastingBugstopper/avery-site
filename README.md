This site runs on
[Vercel](https://vercel.com) and has a small
personal bio. I might add some more
stuff over time but I don't code that much outside of work.

## ClarkTime

[Clark Addis](clarkaddis.com) is a good friend of mine and a while back he made
[ClarkTime](clarkaddis.com/get_hour) as an art project. I wanted to learn a bit
about `cwebp` and `parallel`, and he took ~43,200 pictures for this project so I
decided to port it to my site just for funsies. This lives at
[averyharnish.com/clarktime](https://averyharnish.com/clarktime).
