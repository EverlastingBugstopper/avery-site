# Avery's Personal Site

This is just a small site with a bit of information about me.

[![Lighthouse Best Practices Badge](/lighthouse/badges/bestPractices.svg)](https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper/avery-site)

This website uses no front end framework of any kind. There is some custom tooling that I wrote for generating the lighthouse badges that you can read about [here](./lighthouse/README.md).

This site is powered by
[Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Development

1) Install node (I like [volta](https://volta.sh)).
1) Run `git clone https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper/avery-site; cd avery-site`
1) Run `npm i; npm run start`
1) Your browser should open automatically and reload on any changes made to assets in the `public` directory
